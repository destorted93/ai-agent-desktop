F: Child locks on everything, yes?
M: Typed schemas, explicit allow‑lists, least‑privilege credentials, idempotency keys, and dry‑runs before writes.

M: CRM hygiene—find deals with stale next steps, draft nudges, update stage after replies. Spreadsheet cleanup—fix dates, fill missing IDs from a lookup, highlight anomalies. Calendar—propose slots, create the event, invite people, post a summary. Docs—draft a summary, suggest edits, open a ticket with diffs.
