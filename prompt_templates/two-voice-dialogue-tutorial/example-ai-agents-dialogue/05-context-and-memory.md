F: Headspace—context versus memory. Split them gently.
M: Context is what’s in the head right now: the prompt, recent steps, and relevant snippets we retrieved. It’s short‑term.
F: And memory survives the run.
M: Exactly. We save only what helps next time—preferences, stable IDs, known quirks—timestamped, expiring, and editable.
F: How do policies show up without pasting the handbook?
M: Retrieval. We index docs, pull just the relevant chunks when needed, and cite sources. The model reads those in context.
F: What if a user changes their mind—like “no CSVs, please”?
M: We update or delete the fact. Memory is data, not orders.
F: Pitfalls?
M: Overstuffed context, stale notes, and letting memory become commands. Keep context small and memory inspectable.
F: Got it.
M: With headspace set, the hands matter next—the tools an agent can safely use.
