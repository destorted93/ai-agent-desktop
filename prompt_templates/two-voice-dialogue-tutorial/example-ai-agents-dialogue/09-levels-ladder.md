F: Ladder time—how high do we climb, with examples.
M: L0—No model. Scripts/workflows. Nightly sync with a Slack health ping. Boring wins.
F: Mm.
M: L1—One tool via a model. “Get weather; say if I need an umbrella.” Single shot.
M: L2—Think then act. Small reasoning, one tool. “CSV uses semicolons—use that parser.”
F: Go on.
M: L3—Planner loop. Plan steps, act, check, adjust. “Quarterly revenue: query, fix timezone, verify totals, chart.”
M: L4—Multi‑agent. Roles—planner, researcher, executor, critic—parallel when helpful; more catches, more tokens.
F: When is L4 worth it?
M: Messy research, long reports, big ops runs—places where review or parallelism saves real time.
M: L5—Autonomous system. Goals, memory, scheduling, background runs, self‑healing—with strong guardrails.
F: Picking a rung?
M: Measure success, time, cost, and human assists. Stop at the lowest level that wins. Most wins sit at L2 or L3.
F: And when one brain isn’t enough even at L3?
M: Then we lean on multi‑agent patterns—done carefully.
