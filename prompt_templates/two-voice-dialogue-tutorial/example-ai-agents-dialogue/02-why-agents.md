F: Hands, eyes, nervous system—why do we need that layer?
M: Because work ends with doing. Agents let the model read a page, choose a step, use a tool, check the result, and stop when the job is actually done.
F: Make it real.
M: Support: “My order never arrived.” The agent checks the order and courier, reads policy, issues a replacement, emails the customer, and logs every step.
F: Outcome, not apology. Mm.
M: Ops: “Inventory mismatch.” It pulls counts from store and system, compares, flags gaps, drafts a fix list for the manager.
F: And on guardrails?
M: Tight. Allow‑listed tools, small permissions, timeouts, spend caps. Money, deletes, and customer emails switch to “tap to approve.”
F: Where do these shine today?
M: Support that actually resolves. Spreadsheet and report chores. Small code fixes with tests. Back‑office glue—approvals, reminders, cleanups.
F: Okay.
M: To see how this works, think of an agent like a careful coworker with specific body parts doing specific jobs.
