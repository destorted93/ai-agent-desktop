F: Body parts—walk me through the anatomy.
M: Brain, hands, eyes, a nervous system, memory, a tiny inner critic, a budget wallet, and a clipboard.
F: Go on. Mhm.
M: Brain is the language model—the talker proposing the next sensible step.
M: Hands are tools: APIs, spreadsheets, calendars, email, ticket systems.
M: Eyes are readers: search, files, databases, web pages.
F: Nervous system?
M: The orchestrator. It keeps rhythm: look around, pick one step, do it, see what happened, repeat or stop. It enforces timeouts, budgets, and rules.
F: Memory but not creepy.
M: Short‑term scratchpad for this task; long‑term notes we can look up—docs, past runs, tiny facts like “30‑minute meetings” or “send CSV.” Facts get timestamps and expire.
F: The inner critic.
M: Quick checks—“Do these totals add up?” “Does this SQL touch prod?”—that can block risky moves.
F: And the budget wallet?
M: Caps on tokens, API calls, and dollars. When the wallet’s empty, we stop cleanly.
F: Clipboard is receipts.
M: Every step with inputs and outputs, so humans can audit, undo, and trust.
F: Feels like a careful teammate.
M: Exactly—and that teammate moves in a five‑beat loop.
