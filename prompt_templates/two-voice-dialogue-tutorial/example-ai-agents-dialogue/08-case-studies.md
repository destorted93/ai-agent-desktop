F: Different teams, real results—give me a tour.
M: Support—lost package. Agent confirms loss, issues replacement, emails the customer. CSAT up, resolution time down.
F: Right.
M: Finance—invoices. Reads PDFs, extracts vendor and amount, routes to cost center, posts to approval. Fewer late fees.
F: HR?
M: New hire. Creates accounts, adds to groups, schedules intros, posts a day‑one checklist. Less chaos, happier starts.
F: Sales?
M: Pipeline hygiene. Flags deals with no reply, drafts nudges, updates CRM after responses. Cleaner forecasts.
F: Ops?
M: Inventory mismatch. Compares store counts with system, drafts a fix task list. Shrinkage down, audits easier.
F: Marketing?
M: Content refresh. Finds stale pages, proposes updates, opens tickets with diffs. Less rot, better SEO.
F: Pattern: finish lines, not essays.
M: Exactly—and how fancy the agent needs to be depends on the ladder we pick.
