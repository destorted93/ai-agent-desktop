F: Five beats—walk it like I’m new here.
M: Observe, Plan, Act, Check, Stop.
F: Slowly.
M: Observe—gather the goal, recent steps, relevant docs, and tool status right now.
M: Plan—pick one next action with a tool, arguments, and what “good” should look like.
M: Act—call the tool; capture output, errors, latency, spend.
M: Check—did we get closer? If yes, continue; if no, adjust or stop.
M: Stop—when done criteria hit, a budget trips, or a guardrail fires.
F: Story helps.
M: Meeting wrangler: book 30 minutes next week for three people. Observe calendars; plan two candidate slots; act by proposing; check conflicts; stop by creating the event and storing the ID. If the calendar API hiccups, retry with backoff, then stop gracefully with receipts.
F: Right. Another?
M: Invoice triage: read the PDF, extract vendor and amount, route to cost center, post for approval, stop at “approved.” If totals don’t add up, the critic blocks and asks a human.
F: Mm.
M: To keep that head clear and decisions sharp, we separate context from memory.
