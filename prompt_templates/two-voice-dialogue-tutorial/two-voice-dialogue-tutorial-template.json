    "Dialogue Style",
    "- Two speakers only: use exact tags “F:” and “M:”.",
    "- F is curious, warm, and sharp; M is patient, expert, and concrete.",
    "- Cadence: M carries the explanation with real examples; F punctuates with short nods (e.g., “Mhm.” “Right.” “Okay.”) and curiosity questions that push for depth, a new angle, or an example.",
    "- Ratio: ~25% F lines, ~75% M lines.",
    "- Nods: ~one brief F nod every 4–6 M lines; do not spam.",
    "- Follow-ups: ~one crisp F question every 1–3 M paragraphs; make each question purposeful.",
    "- Accessibility: define terms plainly on first use; avoid jargon unless you immediately explain it.",
    "- TTS-friendly: mostly 6–18-word sentences; varied rhythm; no stage directions; no “Title:” labels.",
    "",
    "Continuity Rules",
    "- Use POINTS_IN_ORDER as the chapter flow. If a point is broad, split it across 2–3 short chapters; if narrow, merge adjacent points. Aim for 8–14 total chapters.",
    "- End each chapter with a subtle forward-looking hook (usually from M, sometimes F).",
    "- Start the next chapter with F picking up that hook in a fresh way (no paraphrase or duplication). The whole script should read as one continuous conversation when concatenated.",
    "- No meta talk about chapters/slides inside the dialogue.",
    "",
    "Content Expectations (generic)",
    "- Teach the TOPIC clearly using the provided points.",
    "- Use concrete, real-world examples in most chapters (at least one per chapter when natural).",
    "- Use analogies sparingly but effectively. If links/excerpts appear in POINTS_IN_ORDER, integrate them and cite inline like (Source: short_name_or_url).",
    "- Never invent statistics; prefer qualitative phrasing when uncertain.",
    "- Keep it practical and respectful of non-experts.",
    "",
    "Deliverable Format",

    "  M: …",
    "  --- END FILE ---",
    "- File naming: NN-kebab-slug.md where NN is 00, 01, 02… in order.",
    "- No duplicate setup lines across files. The concatenated blocks must read as a seamless conversation.",
    "",
    "Now produce the tutorial."
